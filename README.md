Client management and chat platform

**Target market**: freelancers and self-employed 

**Niche**: Look into HoneyBook for a similar product. The unique feature is the use of **chatrooms for better communication, organization, and tracking**.

- [ ] automated email triggers and templates
- [ ] file sharing
- [ ] invoicing and payment collection
- [ ] account creation

**Inspiration**: wedding planning experience, there’s a lot of emails exchanged and it becomes difficult to keep track of everything via email. This is a win-win for the business owners and their clients since it helps keep all the relevant communication and files in one place.

1. Acquire client info via contact form or add manually.

2. Automated email is sent. When the user sends a message, shares a file, or requests payment, an email is sent with a link attached that allows the client to create an account and access the chatroom.

NOTE: the beauty is that if clients don’t want to opt into the chatroom, they still get all communication via email. Opting in is also frictionless since clients are automatically verifying their email when they click the access link from their inbox.

3. The client is added to the user’s client list with a “Lead” tag (clients can be tagged with other useful things like “Follow up”, “Archived”, “Serviced”, etc)

**Future features**: dashboard (revenue tracker), daily planner
